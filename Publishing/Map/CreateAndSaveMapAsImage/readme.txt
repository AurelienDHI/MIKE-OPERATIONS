Sample code for creating a map with feature layers and saving the map to a file on disk.

The script can run without a shell, this means that the script will work if it is running from a scheduled job.

NOTE that this script will work with MIKE OPERATIONS 2019.2 and later versions, and will not work on previous versions.
