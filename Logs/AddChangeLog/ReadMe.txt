If you manipulate entities via scripting in the MIKE OPERATIONS Platform the ChangeLog will naturally be updated with information about the action (who, where, when). 
But the standard information does not include information about "what". (except if the changes are doen via Tools).
The attached script illustrates how to add a Changelogrecord instead of the default one which informs about the name change of the time series.
To test the script - copy paste the code inot the Script Editor and change the variables path, oldName and newName to suit your data.
